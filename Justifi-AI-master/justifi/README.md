This is an application used to host our own Justifi GPT API to allow people from all backgrounds access legal consultation


## How it works?

Ask any legal questions that you may have, and Jurvis - our AI will answer your question with accurate answers according to US federal Law aswell as giving  you references to previous cases where these issues arose.

## How was it made?

We designed and trained an AI LLM using the OpenAI API, implemented into a Full stack web react app during a 24-hour hackathon – CodetheChange, made to allow people from every background access legal consultation.
• Implemented a python web scraper to compile large amounts of case files from major states in America -- then used these files in another python script to convert into readable data to train and fine tune the AI to respond to users.
• Integrated AWS database to send and store API calls back and forth between OpenAI API and React Front End
